They offer a few different vegan options for ice cream, and while they are not as fun or delicious as their regular ice cream offerings, they are such a nice treat when you cannot have dairy (or in my case dairy and soy)! We have also recommended this place to vegan friends as well as brought family members with lactose intolerance here. My mom hasn't had any (good) ice cream in years; when we brought her here I thought she was going to start crying! They have great ice cream that everyone can eat - that deserves 5 stars!\n",

I also don't do sweets, croissants & pastries do nothing for me, and I'm not a latte type of guy.  That being said, my review is strictly for their coffee.  Prices for their coffee is competitive to the rest of the coffee cafes out here. An Americano is less than $3, cold brew is $4, and their 100% Kona Coffee is $5 for a 12 oz. or $6 for a 16 oz. Their cold brew is bold and very strong.  If you're looking for a quick \"pick me up\", then this is the coffee for you.  The caffeine hit is almost instant and the energy boost is sustainable.  Their cold brew is awesome.  But lets be honest here, it's all about the 100% Kona Coffee at Hi-Coffee Café.  I've had a Kona blend and it's not even close to Hi-Coffee's 100% Kona.  100% Kona Coffee is very hard to find because it's expensive.  A 12 oz. bag of 100% Kona beans sell for close to $40.  It's crazy!  Most places that have Kona coffee will serve a blend, which is usually less than 20%. I was at a café in Hawaii a couple of weeks ago and they even used a blend to cut cost.  Hi-Coffee's 100% Kona Coffee is legit.  It has a very smooth taste and because it's not bitter, it's sort of sweet too.  Their cold brew has enough caffeine to wake you up, while their 100% Kona has a steady flow of caffeine that keep you alert for the rest of the day. If you need that boost, then pick your poison.

My husband was so happy that KFT opened that we joke his quality of life in Cleveland improved by 38%. We've tried KFT in Boston and other locations, and this location is comparable. (I did peek inside the San Mateo location once and was horrified at how small and dirty it was! How can you allow it to be part of your franchise?) The interior is super modern and spacious with large LED screens for the menu. Plenty of seating inside and outside on their patio. \\n\\nIt's a part of Kenko, which is a local fast Japanese casual place that franchised KFT. I don't care much for Kenko - I just skip right to the boba. \\n\\nKFT is free of the super sugary high fructose corn syrup. They also do their bubbles right! You can also customize how you like. I usually do less ice, half sugar, and less bubbles.\\n\\nMy favorite flavors are the oolong tea. I also tried the yakult and it's so good!</th>\n",

       "      <th>Good service and atmosphere. The lychee milk tea was delicious and the boba cooked to perfection. We went back the next day and had the coconut slush, which was also very good! Nice little hang out spot for locals and tourists alike! They also serve appetizers.</th>\n",

       "Like others have mentioned, Cleveland has been super slow on the uptake for bubble tea. My husband was so happy that KFT opened that we joke his quality of life in Cleveland improved by 38%. We've tried KFT in Boston and other locations, and this location is comparable. (I did peek inside the San Mateo location once and was horrified at how small and dirty it was! How can you allow it to be part of your franchise?) The interior is super modern and spacious with large LED screens for the menu. Plenty of seating inside and outside on their patio. \n",

       "KFT is free of the super sugary high fructose corn syrup. They also do their bubbles right! You can also customize how you like. I usually do less ice, half sugar, and less bubbles.\n",

       "My favorite flavors are the oolong tea. I also tried the yakult and it's so good!</th>\n",
       "      <th>A little expensive but overall quite good. Their milk green tea is with real 2% milk. It tastes really different from other stores. Their coconut ice shake is also amazing! If you enjoy mangoes, this is 100% the place for you! I somewhat dislike their hot mango drink since it tastes awkward. They also open at 11:00 AM! Will be back!</th>\n",

       "      <th>Our first time in Vegas and we were craving for milk tea. Checked on yelp and found this place with good reviews, i don't think milk tea is really popular in Vegas. This place looks new and the interior is pretty cool, the area were clean! The crew were super friendly. The wait for three people order was pretty quick. Love this place!</th>\n",
       "      <th>We were excited to see the Alley closer to home and decided to give this location a try. It's nice to see more sitting space compared to most Alley locations which will probably serve best for the students nearby. \n",
       "We ordered the Jasmine Milk Green Tea with tapioca and the Lime honey aloe drink. \n",
       "Firstly, perhaps because it is still relatively new, the service was quite slow and there wasn't a lot of people but they had a steady flow of customers. \n",
       "Secondly, my friend actually wanted a slew of other drinks before she settled with the lime honey aloe one and she settled for it because she wasn't able to alter the sweetness of the other ones she wanted. We didn't like the inconsistency of sugar options in their drinks and can't quite understand why some can be altered but some cannot (perhaps someone can enlighten me? ) \n",
       "Thirdly, now this I find in all Alley locations, I just find that the amount of tapioca they give compared to a lot of other boba places lacks noticeably. I feel like I get the same amount in a regular cup as a large and that doesn't really make sense (perhaps someone can enlighten me with this as well). \n",
       "Other than that though, it's pretty much the same as any other Alley.</th>\n",
       "      <th>Oh my gosh, so good! Went in right before closing and got a Thai milk tea boba (my fav) and it totally hit the spot. Noticed this spot while driving by, so glad we stopped! Yum!!!</th>\n",
       "      <th>I like getting their buns here but the women who work here are extremely unfriendly and unhelpful.  They always squish all my purchases in a tiny plastic bag and refuse to give me a larger bag even if I pay the 5 cents for it.  Whenever I let them know that I'd like a larger bag as I don't want my buns to end up all squished when I return home, they are extremely rude and condescending.</th>\n",

Insider knowledge: The owner makes pastries fresh/home made, Delicious! Great place for my girlfriend and I to get coffee and start our day.</th>\n",
       "      <th>If I can rate this place a ten star, I will. But Yelp only allows up to five stars. My husband and I originally 'just' wanted to get their cheese rolls. We've been craving for the Porto's cheese rolls from California for a long while. Anyway, we ended up getting more than that. We had pancit malabon, longsilog, fried vegetable egg roll, 1 bag of pandisal, a dozen of cheese rolls, three guava tools and blueberry rolls. Cheese rolls and pandisal we took them home for our kids. We were hungry so we ate the others in the cafe. And let me tell you. They were all delicious! Chef Zen was very welcoming. She doesn't treat you like a customer. She treats you like family! Before we left she gave us chicken empanada, on the house! We will definitely becoming back Tita Chef Zen! Oh and also, she had us sample her cheese rolls too. We highly recommend this place!</th>\n",
       "      <th>This is the best Boba I ever had in Vegas. The pearls are not too soft and not too hard, it is made to perfection! My favorite here is the avocado smoothie with boba, its not like other places that make it too sweet. For good and cheap boba go to volcano tea!</th>\n",

       "Let's be real, this place can be super annoying. The parking is atrocious (usually going next door to the main Chinatown plaza and walking over is the thing to do if you're not going right when they open) and the credit card minimum obnoxious ($10), but on top of that, the service is also nonexistent (will someone please come and take my money?). However, if you know what you're in for, the drinks and snacks are great.</th>\n",

       "Food: I ordered their mango pancake which I was so confused why it's called a pancake haha. But it tasted light and sweet but not too sweet. I'm not a huge fan of sweet, but this is definitely do-able . I also got the yogi dessert. I think that's what it's called. It was refreshing and very light and sweet. This place is a great place to try something new. A new kind of dessert.\n",

       "My second favorite is the honeydew. Honeydew Snoh is a very refreshing flavor to try during this summer! Do it! The AZ heat don't got nothing on these Snohs!  Might I add, that you must try the mochi balls with both the taro and the honeydew Snoh--the coconut mochi balls are my favorite topping with both Snoh flavors thus far.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me tell you, never in my life have I ordered a small of something and then ordered a regular/large size of it immediately after just because I could not get enough of it... I just love how its pillowy texture and delectable flavors never leave me feeling bloated and guilty.\n",

The espresso seems to be the same brand, but possibly a different roast. It's a clean, bold flavor that has a medium mouthfeel and lingers slightly. \n",

       "      <th>Heard there was a new boba place so I had to try it out. I got the taro milk tea and it was perfectly creamy with just enough boba. Maybe it's because a lot of the boba places in AZ don't cook the boba right but they got it spot on here. They can also adjust the sweetness level of it for you and I recommend getting it a little less sweet. I'm happy that ASU finally gets a good boba place near campus but sad that it's right after I've graduated and am moving away.</th>\n",

The interior is super modern and spacious with large LED screens for the menu. Plenty of seating inside and outside on their patio. \\n\\nIt's a part of Kenko, which is a local fast Japanese casual place that franchised KFT. I don't care much for Kenko - I just skip right to the boba. \\n\\nKFT is free of the super sugary high fructose corn syrup. They also do their bubbles right! You can also customize how you like.

We didn't like the inconsistency of sugar options in their drinks and can't quite understand why some can be altered but some cannot (perhaps someone can enlighten me? ) \\nThirdly, now this I find in all Alley locations, I just find that the amount of tapioca they give compared to a lot of other boba places lacks noticeably.

I'm from Hawaii, so it was either try Brew Tea Bar now since we were here, or wait for another Vegas trip lol...\\n\\nI absolutely loved their milk tea, peach black tea, and their boba!!  They gave a generous amount of tasty boba, which is key to me when drinking teas.  When I drink my teas, I like it when I still have boba towards the end of my drink.  Who likes drinking milk tea with no boba? :P  I like that Brew Tea Bar gave just the right amount of boba for my drinks.\\n\\nMy favorite drinks are milk tea and peach black tea.  I like Brew Tea Bar's milk tea because it's not too milky; it had just the right amount of black tea.  Same goes for the peach black tea; it had just the right amount of black tea and peach syrup.  Their proportions are on par.\\n\\nI am definitely coming back here, next time I make it up to Vegas.

       "      <th>My roommate, Maverick, and I came in for a House MilkTea and a Redbean Tofu MilkTea. The wait was short, and the inside temperature was nice and cool. It was very hot outside.\\nWe got our drinks and both started drinking them inside before heading to the car. My House MilkTea was just right, nice and sweet. I did not ask Maverick how his drink was, but he did not complain. We got in the car and started to back out and head home.\\nJust then, one of the employees came running out to stop us. Her name was Nina. I thought maybe Maverick forgot his debit card or change. Nina asked Maverick if he really liked his drink or not, because she checked the redbeans she had and noticed they were sour. She offered to remake the drink for Maverick, and even let us wait in the car. She returned in a few minutes with a brand new drink. \\nNow I have worked in restaurants and hotels, so I can whole heartedly tell you that this is Grade A, 5 Star, highest level customer service you can get anywhere. Nina could have just let us drive away without worrying about it. But she showed that she cares about customers with action. That's taking initiative, and she brings the business she works at to the next stage. Thank you Nina, and thank you iTea!</th>\n",

I ordered a Thai Milk Tea with Bobo and a little snack, Taiyaki is a Japanese fish-shaped cake. The shape of Tai. The filling is red bean paste that is made from sweetened azuki beans...ypu can get other fillings. So delicious. The tea bar is connected to the Tomo Noodles &amp; Dumplings and on the menu is a Ramen Burger (the burger is made out of Ramen )...can't wait to try that on my next visit.

Individual pots without the smoke and grease.  Good ventilation.  Clean bathrooms.  The metal holder of the pot has a built-in slot for a candle to keep your pot hot.  Great range and combination of food in each pot, with a nice balance of fibres, carbs, and proteins.  Soup base was pretty solid--the essence of the pot.  Good selection of soup base. Clean and fresh ingredients.  Good selection of drinks too, though not very extensive.  What I don't like in their extensive use of single-use plastic.  Upon being seated, you are greeted with a glass of water in a single-use plastic cup, and a straw in wraps. We asked them to take back the straws. With $1 extra, you can order their signature Taiwanese bubble tea drinks, which obviously come in single-use plastic cups and straws.  There were a few types of plastic drink holders that are single-use.  Hope that can be changed.  Expect to come out totally full.  P.S.: the cheese and milk pot was special. But they no longer have sukiyaki soup base, rich is a disappointment.</th>\n",

The menu/pricing is also unclear... each bubble tea will end up costing you $6.50 or more.

We've been craving for the Porto's cheese rolls from California for a long while. Anyway, we ended up getting more than that. We had pancit malabon, longsilog, fried vegetable egg roll, 1 bag of pandisal, a dozen of cheese rolls, three guava tools and blueberry rolls. Cheese rolls and pandisal we took them home for our kids. We were hungry so we ate the others in the cafe. And let me tell you. They were all delicious! Chef Zen was very welcoming. She doesn't treat you like a customer. She treats you like family! Before we left she gave us chicken empanada, on the house! We will definitely becoming back Tita Chef Zen! Oh and also, she had us sample her cheese rolls too. We highly recommend this place!</th>\n",

For those who have never tried it before, don't let its purple hue deceive you--it is delicious!\\nMy second favorite is the honeydew. Honeydew Snoh is a very refreshing flavor to try during this summer! Do it! The AZ heat don't got nothing on these Snohs!  Might I add, that you must try the mochi balls with both the taro and the honeydew Snoh--the coconut mochi balls are my favorite topping with both Snoh flavors thus far.\\n\\nLet me tell you, never in my life have I ordered a small of something and then ordered a regular/large size of it immediately after just because I could not get enough of it... I just love how its pillowy texture and delectable flavors never leave me feeling bloated and guilty.\\n\\nIf you're also wondering about their drinks, they're good too! I like their Thai Tea with boba.\\n\\nSo if you're looking for a new chill treat to try, have a go with Snoh--it's worth it. They did receive a Best of Phoenix...\\n\\n\"Snoh\" will always be year-round in Arizona for me!\\n\\nBonus: You can enjoy your delicious dessert with visuals of the artwork that's for sale; watching what's on their TVs; and playing all sorts of fun games with the people you came with!</th>\n",

My husband was so happy that KFT opened that we joke his quality of life in Cleveland improved by 38%. We've tried KFT in Boston and other locations, and this location is comparable. (I did peek inside the San Mateo location once and was horrified at how small and dirty it was! How can you allow it to be part of your franchise?) The interior is super modern and spacious with large LED screens for the menu. Plenty of seating inside and outside on their patio. \\n\\nIt's a part of Kenko, which is a local fast Japanese casual place that franchised KFT. I don't care much for Kenko - I just skip right to the boba. \\n\\nKFT is free of the super sugary high fructose corn syrup. They also do their bubbles right! You can also customize how you like. I usually do less ice, half sugar, and less bubbles.\\n\\nMy favorite flavors are the oolong tea. I also tried the yakult and it's so good!  \\\n",

It's nice to see more sitting space compared to most Alley locations which will probably serve best for the students nearby. \\nWe ordered the Jasmine Milk Green Tea with tapioca and the Lime honey aloe drink. \\nFirstly, perhaps because it is still relatively new, the service was quite slow and there wasn't a lot of people but they had a steady flow of customers. \\nSecondly, my friend actually wanted a slew of other drinks before she settled with the lime honey aloe one and she settled for it because she wasn't able to alter the sweetness of the other ones she wanted. We didn't like the inconsistency of sugar options in their drinks and can't quite understand why some can be altered but some cannot (perhaps someone can enlighten me? ) \\nThirdly, now this I find in all Alley locations, I just find that the amount of tapioca they give compared to a lot of other boba places lacks noticeably. I feel like I get the same amount in a regular cup as a large and that doesn't really make sense (perhaps someone can enlighten me with this as well). \\nOther than that though, it's pretty much the same as any other Alley.  \\\n",

My husband and I originally 'just' wanted to get their cheese rolls. We've been craving for the Porto's cheese rolls from California for a long while. Anyway, we ended up getting more than that. We had pancit malabon, longsilog, fried vegetable egg roll, 1 bag of pandisal, a dozen of cheese rolls, three guava tools and blueberry rolls. Cheese rolls and pandisal we took them home for our kids. We were hungry so we ate the others in the cafe. And let me tell you. They were all delicious! Chef Zen was very welcoming. She doesn't treat you like a customer. She treats you like family! Before we left she gave us chicken empanada, on the house! We will definitely becoming back Tita Chef Zen! Oh and also, she had us sample her cheese rolls too. We highly recommend this place!  \\\n",

I would say each item would average about $4 weather is a drink or the dessert. \\n\\nFood: I ordered their mango pancake which I was so confused why it's called a pancake haha. But it tasted light and sweet but not too sweet. I'm not a huge fan of sweet, but this is definitely do-able . I also got the yogi dessert. I think that's what it's called. It was refreshing and very light and sweet. This place is a great place to try something new. A new kind of dessert.\\n\\nOther: I love their interior design too. They got cute chairs that matches their dessert theme haha. Love it.  \\\n",

For those who have never tried it before, don't let its purple hue deceive you--it is delicious!\\nMy second favorite is the honeydew. Honeydew Snoh is a very refreshing flavor to try during this summer! Do it! The AZ heat don't got nothing on these Snohs!  Might I add, that you must try the mochi balls with both the taro and the honeydew Snoh--the coconut mochi balls are my favorite topping with both Snoh flavors thus far.\\n\\nLet me tell you, never in my life have I ordered a small of something and then ordered a regular/large size of it immediately after just because I could not get enough of it... I just love how its pillowy texture and delectable flavors never leave me feeling bloated and guilty.\\n\\nIf you're also wondering about their drinks, they're good too! I like their Thai Tea with boba.\\n\\nSo if you're looking for a new chill treat to try, have a go with Snoh--it's worth it. They did receive a Best of Phoenix...\\n\\n\"Snoh\" will always be year-round in Arizona for me!\\n\\nBonus: You can enjoy your delicious dessert with visuals of the artwork that's for sale; watching what's on their TVs; and playing all sorts of fun games with the people you came with!  \\\n",

I was extremely happy with the Vietnamese Cold Brew with condensed milk. The espresso seems to be the same brand, but possibly a different roast. It's a clean, bold flavor that has a medium mouthfeel and lingers slightly. \\n\\nThe staff is welcoming and quick, so I can definitely appreciate that. This store has a lot of potential. I love the industrial feel and spaciousness; overall, I look forward to seeing the growth and getting a taste of the new house-made items.  \\\n",

Maybe it's because a lot of the boba places in AZ don't cook the boba right but they got it spot on here. They can also adjust the sweetness level of it for you and I recommend getting it a little less sweet. I'm happy that ASU finally gets a good boba place near campus but sad that it's right after I've graduated and am moving away.  \n",

I did feel that it could be a little crispier and the portion could be a tad bigger. I'm not sure if it's because of the to go box they put it in, but when I opened the bag, it left me wondering... where did the rest of my chicken go? I think I'm just very used to other boba spots putting their popcorn chicken in a white paper bag. It's a good size for one person, but if you're expecting to share then you should probably order another one because it's pretty darn tasty. \n",

      "Saw someone on IG post about Tea of Joy and decided to check it out. Also saw on the IG page that they had their grand opening so it was 20% off until 3/17. So that was a plus! LARGE PARKING LOT with tons of parking. They have a big well lit patio with a swing and a cute tea of joy back drop. \n",

      "Desserts include creme brûlée, panna cotta, tiramisu and a variety of macarons. \n",
      "I like that they offer different snacks like bulgogi fries, fish balls, sweet potato fries and brick toast at reasonable prices. The brick toast looked delicious, a table next to us ordered it and didn't finish it! \n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I were given a sample of their panda milk tea and dragon milk tea. Both were good but the panda milk tea was sweeter than the dragon. The panda milk tea comes with crystal and honey boba (black & white) thus making it panda. The dragon comes with coffee jelly and honey boba. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the large panda milk tea (5.35) and the jasmine sea salt (5.50). After $1 tip my total came out to 11.75. I asked the cashier about the 20% off and he said it was on there.... ok. I didn't want to argue but I didn't get it and my friends who ordered 3 drinks before me also did not get the discount. So, make sure you check your receipt at all future events! \n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes later someone comes out going table to table bringing us our drinks. I like that they bring it out but their current method is not efficient. I would recommend giving customers numbers to place on the table or wherever they are sitting so that it's visible to staff. The staff had to ask people if they ordered X drink many times. Another way would be to not bring out drinks and have people come up and pick up their drinks similar to other milk tea places around town. Once it starts getting busier, I don't think staff will be able to keep up with their current method. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have games! I couldn't tell if it was a PlayStation or what but I did see some people sitting playing games on the tv. They also offer board games! It was very loud when we went at 11:30 PM, I'm not sure how it is in the morning but I don't think I personally would be able to study there. It's definitely a nice place to sit back and catch up with friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "They still have a few kinks to work out but they're new so it's ok. Drinks do take a while to come out even though it looks like there's quite a few people working. They ran out of honey boba when I came so we substituted coffee jelly in the panda milk tea and it was still very good. Their crystal boba is actually VERY good. It was a good consistency and I was surprised when I tried it. They did mess up on two of our drinks but we let someone know and he fixed it right away. \n",

      "Someone mentioned that Tea of Joys tea is too bitter and that the tea is made fresh in the morning... a lot of places actually brew their tea in batches before hand and when it runs out, they will brew some more! Anyway, the tea is perfect IMO. My friends and I love a stronger tea flavor and I've tried almost every milk tea place in Vegas and quite a few in LA/OC. I'd say Tea of Joy is one of the better places to get your milk tea. However I'd have to warn you that their tea is STRONG. It kept me up all night!! That doesn't usually happen to me. I hope they keep up with their consistency and great customer service! I'm definitely coming to Tea of Joy from now on.\n",

      "Tea of Joy is located right next to Magal (which is probably my favorite Vegas KBBQ place, but I digress). Since there are essentially only two food places in this plaza, parking is super easy to find. There is a huge patio leading up to the entrance, which I imagine will eventually be filled up with cute tables. The decor is very simple and clean; they have a wood theme going on, which I think is very photo friendly and cute. In addition to the usual tables/chairs, they also have a hangout corner where you can play on their PS4. They also had a bookshelf with Scrabble and Sorry--I imagine they will be filling those shelves with more games in the future.\n",

      "They have a huge huge menu. Their special drinks had innovative names but didn't help much in figuring out what the drinks were made of--so it was really nice of the workers to walk us through the menu. I asked which drinks they recommended/what their favorites were. I got their green thai milk tea with boba, and my friend got their jasmine milk tea. They were not selling the items on their \"snack menu\" just yet. I talked to the workers, and apparently they just had their grand opening yesterday (2/1/17).

So if anybody actually gets to this paragraph of my review, I would take all the 5 star reviews with a grain of salt. (LOL, I know I write stupidly long reviews.)

      "Their drinks definitely are very strong in tea flavor. I appreciate that. I actually really liked my friend's jasmine milk tea. The green thai milk tea left me a little confused; even now, I'm not really sure how to describe the taste. But for sure, it's nothing like the thai tea we're normally used to. Instead, the green thai milk tea is super duper duper heavy on the tea flavor\n",
      "The boba was chewy and soft, but I wish it would have more flavor to it--the boba didn't actually taste like anything.\n",
      "The macarons we had were fruity pebbles and cocoa pebbles. My friend and I both agreed that the filling was good. We did not really like the macaron cookie itself; I felt like the almond flour was not sifted properly--so the cookie texture was grainy.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR This place has a lot of potential. It is pretty pricey. They have a huge selection (and I am actually really excited for their snack menu). Their customer service is SO.ON.POINT. Once they get that credit card machine running/start selling snacks, I can imagine this could be a popular hang out spot.\n",

      "Without a doubt Kung Fu tea has my favorite atmosphere. First, they have the coolest machine that shakes your drinks. I haven't seen any other boba places that do this. Second, they have cool Bruce Lee memorbilia all over the place (obviously called Kung Fu tea). The tea selection is great. I only have two small complaints. I ordered taro bubble tea and they asked how sweet I wanted it (they have different levels of sweetness). Since I love sugar I ordered the maximum sweetness, however when I got it it tasted extra \"tea\" flavor and less taro sugar flavor. So I'm not sure if the sweetness refers to the amount of tea flavor they use or the amount of sugar flavor or whatever. They are the only place I know which adjust the sweetness like this so that is very cool, just make sure to clarify which sweetness.\n",

I don't know if this is the norm during peak hours but I simply couldn't wait. I don't hold this against the tea place as this is a good sign and I congratulate them, but still it sucks having to wait. You also have to be patient while waiting for the tea as it can take some time. \n",

      "3.5/5 popcorn chicken was pretty good, well seasoned and had a nice kick to it. The dipping sauce they provided complimented it very well. I did feel that it could be a little crispier and the portion could be a tad bigger. I'm not sure if it's because of the to go box they put it in, but when I opened the bag, it left me wondering... where did the rest of my chicken go? I think I'm just very used to other boba spots putting their popcorn chicken in a white paper bag. It's a good size for one person, but if you're expecting to share then you should probably order another one because it's pretty darn tasty. \n",

      "Saw someone on IG post about Tea of Joy and decided to check it out. Also saw on the IG page that they had their grand opening so it was 20% off until 3/17. So that was a plus! LARGE PARKING LOT with tons of parking. They have a big well lit patio with a swing and a cute tea of joy back drop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Desserts include creme brûlée, panna cotta, tiramisu and a variety of macarons. \n",
      "I like that they offer different snacks like bulgogi fries, fish balls, sweet potato fries and brick toast at reasonable prices. The brick toast looked delicious, a table next to us ordered it and didn't finish it! \n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I were given a sample of their panda milk tea and dragon milk tea. Both were good but the panda milk tea was sweeter than the dragon. The panda milk tea comes with crystal and honey boba (black & white) thus making it panda. The dragon comes with coffee jelly and honey boba. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the large panda milk tea (5.35) and the jasmine sea salt (5.50). After $1 tip my total came out to 11.75. I asked the cashier about the 20% off and he said it was on there.... ok. I didn't want to argue but I didn't get it and my friends who ordered 3 drinks before me also did not get the discount. So, make sure you check your receipt at all future events! \n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes later someone comes out going table to table bringing us our drinks. I like that they bring it out but their current method is not efficient. I would recommend giving customers numbers to place on the table or wherever they are sitting so that it's visible to staff. The staff had to ask people if they ordered X drink many times. Another way would be to not bring out drinks and have people come up and pick up their drinks similar to other milk tea places around town. Once it starts getting busier, I don't think staff will be able to keep up with their current method. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have games! I couldn't tell if it was a PlayStation or what but I did see some people sitting playing games on the tv. They also offer board games! It was very loud when we went at 11:30 PM, I'm not sure how it is in the morning but I don't think I personally would be able to study there. It's definitely a nice place to sit back and catch up with friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "They still have a few kinks to work out but they're new so it's ok. Drinks do take a while to come out even though it looks like there's quite a few people working. They ran out of honey boba when I came so we substituted coffee jelly in the panda milk tea and it was still very good. Their crystal boba is actually VERY good. It was a good consistency and I was surprised when I tried it. They did mess up on two of our drinks but we let someone know and he fixed it right away. \n",
      "\n",
      "Someone mentioned that Tea of Joys tea is too bitter and that the tea is made fresh in the morning... a lot of places actually brew their tea in batches before hand and when it runs out, they will brew some more! Anyway, the tea is perfect IMO. My friends and I love a stronger tea flavor and I've tried almost every milk tea place in Vegas and quite a few in LA/OC. I'd say Tea of Joy is one of the better places to get your milk tea. However I'd have to warn you that their tea is STRONG. It kept me up all night!! That doesn't usually happen to me. I hope they keep up with their consistency and great customer service! I'm definitely coming to Tea of Joy from now on.\n",
